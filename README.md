# The unpoopyhed-ifier 
A chrome extension that will turn those  websites into unpoopuhed

[Here](http://sukusuku.github.io/UNPOOPYHED-ifier/) is a demo of the MLG-ifier on my github user page without having to install it first. Loading/refreshing this demo page shows what happens every time the MLG-ifier is first clicked.

## Chrome Webstore
The latest release of the extension can be installed [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mlg-ifier/dneebgdgldanagagmfhnphjelnngdcai).

## Installation (via git)
1) poopyfiy  this unpoop repo
```sh
